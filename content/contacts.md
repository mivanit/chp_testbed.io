## Partner Organizations

- **CIROH** — Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (University of Alabama)
- **RTI International** — Developers of the TEEHR evaluation framework
- **NOAA/NWS** — National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / National Weather Service
- **Colorado School of Mines** — Hydrology and Water Resources Program

## Governance

The testbed is associated with **CIROH Project 1** (led by Andy Wood, Colorado School of Mines) and is a core component of **CIROH Theme 1 — Advancing Operational Prediction**.

### Engagement Mechanisms

- **Quarterly Steering Group Meetings** — Leads from linked activities and CIROH RTs review testbed progress
- **Quarterly Open Webinars** — Highlight testbed activities and engage the community (CIROH and external)
- **CIROH Slack Testbed Channel** — Available to CIROH partners to connect with collaborators

### External Coordination

The testbed coordinates with:

- Office of Water Prediction (OWP) and National Water Center (NWC)
- NWS River Forecast Centers
- World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
- CIROH leadership and RT4 (stakeholder communication)

## Participate

We welcome contributions from the hydrologic research community. There are several ways to get involved.

### Submit Results

Interested in submitting model results for protocol evaluation?

1. Review protocol specifications on the [Protocols](./protocols/index.html) page
2. Run your model according to the experimental design specifications
3. Prepare outputs in the required format (see protocol documentation)
4. Submit via GitHub pull request or contact the protocol lead

### Propose New Protocols

Have an idea for a new evaluation protocol?

- Identify a gap in current prediction evaluation approaches
- Define clear objectives, reference baselines, and performance metrics
- Contact the project team to discuss your proposal

Note: As protocols become established, they become more difficult to change without affecting the consistency of prior results.

### Contribute to Development

Help improve the testbed infrastructure. You can contribute to:

- Evaluation tools and metrics implementations
- Data processing pipelines
- Website and documentation
- Protocol definitions and specifications

## Contact

For general inquiries about the testbed, protocol submissions, or collaboration opportunities, please reach out to the project team through the resources listed above or via the partner institution websites.

The CHPT lead (Andy Wood) can be contacted to discuss project activities, assess feasibility of running experiments, and discuss potential protocol refinements.
