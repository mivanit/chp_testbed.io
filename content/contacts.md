## Partner Organizations

- **CIROH** — Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (University of Alabama)
- **RTI International** — Developers of the TEEHR evaluation framework
- **NOAA/NWS** — National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / National Weather Service
- **Colorado School of Mines** — Hydrology and Water Resources Program

## Participate

We welcome contributions from the hydrologic research community. There are several ways to get involved.

### Submit Results

Interested in submitting model results for protocol evaluation?

1. Review protocol specifications on the [Protocols](./protocols/index.html) page
2. Run your model according to the experimental design specifications
3. Prepare outputs in the required format (see protocol documentation)
4. Submit via GitHub pull request or contact the protocol lead

### Propose New Protocols

Have an idea for a new evaluation protocol?

- Identify a gap in current prediction evaluation approaches
- Define clear objectives, reference baselines, and performance metrics
- Contact the project team to discuss your proposal

### Contribute to Development

Help improve the testbed infrastructure. You can contribute to:

- Evaluation tools and metrics implementations
- Data processing pipelines
- Website and documentation
- Protocol definitions and specifications
