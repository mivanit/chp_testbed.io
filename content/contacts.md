## Partner Organizations

- **CIROH** — Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology
- **RTI International** — TEEHR development and evaluation tools
- **NOAA/NWS** — National Weather Service operational forecasting
- **Colorado School of Mines** — Hydrology Research Group

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from the hydrology research community. There are several ways to participate:

### Submit Model Results

Have a model or method you'd like to evaluate against our protocols?

1. Review the protocol specifications on the [Protocols](./protocols/index.html) page
2. Run your model according to the experimental design
3. Prepare your outputs in the required format
4. Submit via GitHub pull request or email to project leads

### Propose New Protocols

Have an idea for a new evaluation protocol?

- Identify a gap in current hydrologic prediction evaluation
- Define clear objectives, baselines, and metrics
- Contact the project team to discuss your proposal

### Contribute to Development

The testbed infrastructure is open source. You can contribute to:

- Evaluation tools and metrics
- Data processing pipelines
- Website and documentation
- Protocol definitions
