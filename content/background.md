## Overview

The US NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) is a consortium of US institutions (academic, private, non-profit) that collectively partner with the US National Water Center (NWC) to conduct research to advance operational hydrologic forecasting services.

One CIROH project being conducted at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) is the **CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed (CHPT)** -- a community-oriented initiative to establish rigorous, quantitative intercomparison and benchmarking of US operational hydrologic forecasts, and particularly the multiple elements -- models, methods, datasets -- involved in producing them.

The testbed promotes a multi-faceted benchmark-oriented paradigm through facilitating the use of multiple community-based experimental protocols with standardized evaluation tools, targeting different forecasting and forecasting sub-component objectives. Examples of sub-components include model formulations, model parameterizations (e.g., a glacier physics algorithm), input datasets, and techniques (e.g., data assimilation, post-processing, ensemble methods), across timescales from nowcasting to multi-season prediction.

## Testbed Linkages

The testbed depends on linkages with other components of CIROH, and also leverages external resources, including datasets and expertise from agencies and groups related to operational Earth System monitoring and prediction.

Within CIROH, the Testbed project coordinates directly with three main activities:

### Model and Forecast Evaluation

The testbed co-designs forecast-related evaluation experiments and workflows to make use of the RTI evaluation tools (namely [TEEHR](https://github.com/RTIInternational/teehr)), where appropriate.

### CIROH Cyber-Infrastructure

The testbed steers and facilitates the use of the CIROH Cyber-Infrastructure to enable CIROH teams to test innovations and generate outputs matching the testbed protocols. The C-I and data science theme projects provide data services and computational resources that can be used in forecast evaluations.

### CIROH Project Advances

The ultimate value of the testbed depends on the engagement of CIROH project teams to assess their innovations in the benchmark-oriented structure provided by the protocols.

### External Coordination

The testbed also coordinates with other efforts and groups, including (but not limited to):

- OWP and NWC (Office of Water Prediction and National Water Center)
- NWS River Forecast Centers
- WMO (World Meteorological Organization)
- CIROH leadership and RT4 (stakeholder communication and product activities)

These partnerships help translate quantitative testbed insights into messaging that resonates with forecast users.

## Engaging with the Testbed

CIROH project teams, external collaborators and interested parties can engage with the testbed through:

1. **Identifying an existing protocol** that aligns with their research questions or activities
2. **Proposing a new community protocol** to address emerging evaluation needs
3. **Contacting protocol leads** to discuss project activities and assess feasibility of running experiments

Note: As protocols become established, they become more difficult to change without affecting the consistency of prior results.

## Governance and Activities

The testbed is associated with **CIROH Project 1** (led by Andy Wood, Colorado School of Mines) and is a core component of **CIROH Theme 1 -- Advancing Operational Prediction**.

### Steering and Engagement

- **Quarterly steering group meetings** with leads from linked activities and CIROH RTs to review progress
- **Quarterly open webinar/discussion meetings** to highlight activities and engage the community (CIROH and external)
- **CIROH Slack testbed channel** available to CIROH partners to connect with collaborators

## Funding Acknowledgment

This project is supported by the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology. Funding was awarded to CIROH through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with The University of Alabama (NA22NWS4320003). The CIROH subproject supporting the testbed is entitled "CIROH Hydrometeorological Prediction Testbed", awarded in 2022 and led by Andy Wood.
