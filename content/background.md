The CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed is a collaborative platform built by hydrologists for hydrologists, designed to advance the science of streamflow prediction through standardized evaluation protocols.

## History

The testbed emerged from a recognized need within the hydrologic research community to address challenges in model evaluation and comparison. Historically, hydrologic modeling advances have been difficult to reproduce and compare due to inconsistent benchmarks, varying metrics, and isolated academic findings.

This initiative brings together researchers from multiple institutions to create a unified framework for assessing and demonstrating advancements in hydrologic forecasting, enabling both quick exploratory evaluation and formal protocol-based assessments.

## Motivation

This project addresses key challenges in hydrology:

- Establishing standardized benchmarks for consistent model evaluation
- Defining common metrics to assess forecasting performance objectively
- Tackling model irreproducibility across different research groups
- Reducing the impact of isolated academic findings that cannot be validated
- Enabling rapid turnaround in forecasting loops for iterative improvement

## Objectives

The testbed is designed to support the hydrologic prediction community through:

1. **Standardized Protocols** — Define consistent evaluation frameworks with specified observations, baselines, and metrics
2. **Collaborative Modeling** — Enable teams to share, edit, and execute models using common infrastructure
3. **Transparent Evaluation** — Provide reproducible performance assessments using tools like TEEHR
4. **Knowledge Sharing** — Publish successful protocols and findings to benefit the broader community

## Consortium

The testbed is a collaborative effort supported by major institutions in hydrologic research:

- **CIROH** — Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (University of Alabama)
- **RTI International** — Developers of the TEEHR evaluation framework
- **NOAA/NWS** — National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / National Weather Service
- **Colorado School of Mines** — Hydrology and Water Resources Program
