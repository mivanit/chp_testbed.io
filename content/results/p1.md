## Protocol 1: Daily Streamflow Simulation Results

This page presents performance comparisons for Protocol 1, evaluating daily streamflow simulation across CAMELS catchments.

## Metric Definitions

<div class="card">
<h3>Understanding the Metrics</h3>

**KGE (Kling-Gupta Efficiency)** — A comprehensive metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. Values range from -∞ to 1, with 1 being perfect. KGE > 0 indicates the model outperforms using the mean observed value.

**NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency)** — Measures how well the model explains variance in observations. Values range from -∞ to 1, with 1 being perfect. NSE > 0 indicates model is better than climatology.

**rBias (Relative Bias)** — The systematic over/under-prediction as a percentage. Values near 0 indicate minimal bias. Positive values indicate over-prediction.

**RMAE (Relative Mean Absolute Error)** — Average absolute error normalized by observed values. Lower values indicate better performance.

## Notes

- Results are computed over the validation period (1990-1999)
- Metrics are averaged across all CAMELS catchments in the evaluation subset
- Higher KGE/NSE values indicate better performance
- Lower rBias/RMAE values indicate better performance
- Baseline values serve as reference points for evaluating innovations

## Analyses

*Analysis graphics comparing model performance across different catchment characteristics, flow regimes, and seasons will be added as the protocol matures.*

Planned visualizations include:
- Performance distribution maps across CAMELS basins
- Seasonal performance breakdowns
- Flow regime analysis (high flow vs. low flow skill)
- Regional performance patterns
