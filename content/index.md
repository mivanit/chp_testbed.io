## About HydrometBench

HydrometBench is a community-oriented initiative to establish rigorous, quantitative intercomparison and benchmarking of US operational hydrologic forecasts, and particularly the multiple elements -- models, methods, datasets -- involved in producing them.

The testbed's overarching goal is to address the problematic lack of coherence of research into fundamental challenges and needs for operational prediction systems, which is a significant impediment to intercomparison, benchmarking, and synergistic learning across diverse investments into forecasting research and development.

The testbed promotes a multi-faceted benchmark-oriented paradigm through facilitating the use of multiple community-based experimental protocols with standardized evaluation tools, targeting different forecasting and forecasting sub-component objectives across timescales from nowcasting to multi-season prediction.

## Current Focus

**Protocols are the heart of the testbed.** Our current focus includes streamflow simulation, short-range forecasting, snow water equivalent analysis, and climate prediction at multiple timescales.

## The Process

The [TEEHR](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/) (Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research) framework powers our evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized performance assessments across diverse modeling approaches. The testbed is designed for quick turnaround in a forecasting loop, enabling both rapid exploratory evaluation and formal protocol-based assessments.
