## About the Testbed

This project addresses challenges in hydrology by establishing standardized benchmarks and common metrics to assess and demonstrate advancements in hydrologic forecasting. We tackle issues like model irreproducibility and the impact of isolated academic findings.

The testbed is designed for quick turnaround in a forecasting loop, enabling both rapid exploratory evaluation and formal protocol-based assessments. Built by hydrologists for hydrologists.

## Current Focus

**Protocols are the heart of the testbed.** Our current focus is Protocol 1: retrospective streamflow simulation performance across multiple verification features using CAMELS catchments.

## The Process

Forecasting takes into account different systems and components. The [TEEHR](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/) (Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research) framework powers our evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized performance assessments across diverse modeling approaches.
