## Performance Metrics

Performance metrics will be defined as part of the protocol specification process. Expected metrics include:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **SWE Bias** | Mean bias in catchment-averaged SWE estimates |
| **Peak SWE Error** | Accuracy of maximum SWE magnitude |
| **Timing Error** | Accuracy of peak SWE date |
| **Melt Rate** | Accuracy of snow ablation rate |

## Reference Baselines

Reference capabilities will be determined during protocol development.

## Results Summary

Results from evaluated innovations will be displayed here when the protocol is finalized and submissions are processed.

## Submitting Results

Protocol submission guidelines will be published when the protocol specification is complete.

See [Contacts](../../contacts.html) for protocol lead contact information.
