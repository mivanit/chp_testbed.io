## Additional Details

### Background

Sub-seasonal prediction (week 2 - month 2) represents a challenging timescale that bridges weather forecasting and seasonal climate prediction. This "predictability gap" is increasingly important for water management and early warning systems.

### Experimental Design

Protocol details are under development. The experimental design will specify:

- Spatial domains
- Forecast lead times (week 2 through month 2)
- Validation periods
- Required model outputs

### Performance Metrics

Performance metrics will be defined as part of the protocol specification process.

### Related Publications

Publications will be listed when the protocol is finalized.
