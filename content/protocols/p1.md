---

This protocol establishes a framework for evaluating retrospective daily streamflow simulation performance across the CAMELS catchment dataset, using standardized metrics and validation approaches.

## Focus/Objective

Retrospective streamflow simulation performance across multiple verification features, including peak flows, low flows, and overall hydrograph characteristics.

## Observational Data

USGS streamgage measurements of flow at hourly and daily timesteps, quality-controlled and gap-filled where necessary.

## Reference Capabilities (Baselines)

- **NWS RFC SAC-SMA/Snow17** — Operational River Forecast Center calibrated models
- **NWM 3.0** — National Water Model version 3.0 streamflow retrospective
- **NextGen NWM** — NextGen-based NWM default configuration

## Experimental Design

```{.csv_table source="content/resources/data/p1-design.csv" header=1}
```

## Metrics of Performance

- **Flow characteristics**: Peak flow magnitude and timing, cumulative flow volume
- **Skill scores**: Modified KGE, NSE
- **Threshold metrics**: ETS for flow vs. flood thresholds
- **Accuracy metrics**: Correlation, relative bias (rBias), RMAE
- **Visualization**: Quadrant bias/correlation charts
- All metrics also expressed relative to reference capability

## Other Considerations

- Computational demand of innovation
- Stability of dependencies (method, dataset versions)
- Potential operational latency
- Extent of documentation and published research
- Potential for forecaster training and real-time support
- Dependency on proprietary resources or methods
