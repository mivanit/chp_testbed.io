<span class="badge badge-active">Active</span>

This protocol establishes a framework for evaluating retrospective daily streamflow simulation performance across the CAMELS catchment dataset, using standardized metrics and validation approaches.

## Protocol Elements

<div class="card">
<h3>Focus/Objective</h3>
Retrospective streamflow simulation performance across multiple verification features, including peak flows, low flows, and overall hydrograph characteristics.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Observational Data</h3>
USGS streamgage measurements of flow at hourly and daily timesteps, quality-controlled and gap-filled where necessary.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Reference Capabilities (Baselines)</h3>

- **NWS RFC SAC-SMA/Snow17** — Operational River Forecast Center calibrated models
- **NWM 3.0** — National Water Model version 3.0 streamflow retrospective
- **NextGen NWM** — NextGen-based NWM default configuration
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Experimental Design</h3>

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Spatial Domain | CAMELS catchments (671 basins) and subsets (516 hourly gages, RFC-forecasted) |
| Validation Period | 10 years: 1990-1999 |
| Timesteps | Daily, 6-hourly, hourly |
| Validation Types | Temporal (all basins), spatial cross-validation, spatial+temporal CV |
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Metrics of Performance</h3>

- **Flow characteristics**: Peak flow magnitude and timing, cumulative flow volume
- **Skill scores**: Modified KGE, NSE
- **Threshold metrics**: ETS for flow vs. flood thresholds
- **Accuracy metrics**: Correlation, relative bias (rBias), RMAE
- **Visualization**: Quadrant bias/correlation charts
- All metrics also expressed relative to reference capability
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>

- Computational demand of innovation
- Stability of dependencies (method, dataset versions)
- Potential operational latency
- Extent of documentation and published research
- Potential for forecaster training and real-time support
- Dependency on proprietary resources or methods
