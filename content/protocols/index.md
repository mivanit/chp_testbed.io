Protocols are the heart of the testbed. They define standardized evaluation frameworks for assessing hydrologic prediction performance.

## What is a Protocol?

A protocol specifies the complete evaluation framework including: the focus/objective, observation datasets, reference baselines, experimental design (spatial domain, validation period, timesteps), performance metrics, and other considerations. This standardization enables reproducible comparisons across different modeling approaches.

## Protocol Elements

Each protocol contains the following universal elements:

- **Objective or focus**: predictands, analyses, forecast information
- **Observational datasets**: data used for validation and verification
- **Reference capabilities**: baselines against which to assess innovations
- **Experimental design**: periods, catchments/domain, lead times, consistency requirements
- **Metrics of performance**: absolute and relative performance measures
- **Other considerations**: computational expense, portability, complexity, dependencies
- **Key references**: relevant studies and external activities
- **Contacts**: protocol leads and active contributors
- **Metadata**: machine-readable information structure for each innovation

## Proposing New Protocols

Interested in proposing a new evaluation protocol? We welcome contributions from the hydrologic research community. Contact the project leads through the [Contacts](../contacts.html) page or open an issue on GitHub with your proposal.
