## Additional Details

### Background

Water supply forecasts (WSFs) provide predictions of seasonal runoff volumes that are critical for water management, reservoir operations, and allocation decisions. These forecasts are typically issued for the April-July or similar seasonal periods in snowmelt-dominated basins.

### Reference Capabilities

NOAA River Forecast Center (RFC) volumetric water supply forecasts will serve as a reference capability against which to benchmark new innovations.

### Experimental Design

Protocol details are under development. The experimental design will specify:

- Target forecast points
- Forecast seasons and lead times
- Validation periods
- Required model outputs

### Performance Metrics

Performance metrics will be defined as part of the protocol specification process.

### Related Publications

Publications will be listed when the protocol is finalized.
