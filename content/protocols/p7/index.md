## Additional Details

### Background

Point-based SWE analysis evaluates the accuracy of SWE estimates at specific locations, typically corresponding to monitoring stations like SNOTEL sites. This differs from Protocol 3 (Catchment Areal SWE) by focusing on point estimates rather than catchment-integrated values.

### Experimental Design

Protocol details are under development. The experimental design will specify:

- Target monitoring sites
- Validation periods
- Required model outputs
- Consistency requirements

### Performance Metrics

Performance metrics will be defined as part of the protocol specification process.

### Related Publications

Publications will be listed when the protocol is finalized.
