        <h2 id="about-hydrometbench">About HydrometBench</h2>
<p>HydrometBench is a community-oriented initiative to establish
rigorous, quantitative intercomparison and benchmarking of US
operational hydrologic forecasts, and particularly the multiple elements
– models, methods, datasets – involved in producing them.</p>
<p>The testbed’s overarching goal is to address the problematic lack of
coherence of research into fundamental challenges and needs for
operational prediction systems, which is a significant impediment to
intercomparison, benchmarking, and synergistic learning across diverse
investments into forecasting research and development.</p>
<p>The testbed promotes a multi-faceted benchmark-oriented paradigm
through facilitating the use of multiple community-based experimental
protocols with standardized evaluation tools, targeting different
forecasting and forecasting sub-component objectives across timescales
from nowcasting to multi-season prediction.</p>
<h2 id="current-focus">Current Focus</h2>
<p><strong>Protocols are the heart of the testbed.</strong> Our current
focus includes streamflow simulation, short-range forecasting, snow
water equivalent analysis, and climate prediction at multiple
timescales.</p>

Protocols</a></p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/">TEEHR</a>
(Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research) framework
powers our evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized performance
assessments across diverse modeling approaches. The testbed is designed
for quick turnaround in a forecasting loop, enabling both rapid
exploratory evaluation and formal protocol-based assessments.</p>
