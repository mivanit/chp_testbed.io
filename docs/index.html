<p>The CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed (CHPT) is a community-driven
platform for benchmarking hydrologic forecasting innovations. We address
critical challenges in hydrology by establishing standardized protocols,
common metrics, and shared datasets to assess and demonstrate
advancements in hydrologic prediction.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and
operational forecasting by providing reproducible evaluation frameworks
that enable meaningful comparisons across different modeling
approaches.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<div class="feature-grid">
<div class="feature-card">
<h3>
Standardized Protocols
</h3>
<p>
Well-defined experimental frameworks that specify objectives, datasets,
baselines, and metrics for consistent evaluation across contributors.
</p>
</div>
<div class="feature-card">
<h3>
Open Evaluation
</h3>
<p>
Transparent benchmarking against established operational baselines like
NWM and RFC models, with results publicly shared.
</p>
</div>
<div class="feature-card">
<h3>
Community-Driven
</h3>
<p>
Collaborative development involving CIROH, NOAA, universities, and
research institutions to advance hydrologic science.

<h2 id="how-to-participate">How to Participate</h2>
<ol class="steps">
<li>
<strong>Review Protocols</strong> — Browse the available protocols to
find one that matches your research focus and modeling capabilities.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Prepare Your Results</strong> — Run your model according to the
protocol specifications (domain, period, timesteps) and compute the
required metrics.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Submit for Evaluation</strong> — Package your results and submit
them through GitHub for inclusion in the testbed results.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Compare and Iterate</strong> — View how your approach compares
to baselines and other contributions, then refine your methods.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="current-focus">Current Focus</h2>
<p>Our first protocol focuses on <strong>daily streamflow
simulation</strong> across CAMELS catchments, comparing innovations
against NWM and RFC operational baselines. This protocol is actively
accepting contributions.</p>

Details</a></p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>The testbed is designed for rapid turnaround in evaluation cycles.
Contributors submit model outputs which are evaluated using <a
href="https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/">TEEHR</a> (Tools for
Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research) against standardized
metrics. Results are compiled and published for community review.</p>
