        <h1>Background</h1>

        

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The US NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in
Hydrology (CIROH) is a consortium of US institutions (academic, private,
non-profit) that collectively partner with the US National Water Center
(NWC) to conduct research to advance operational hydrologic forecasting
services.</p>
<p>One CIROH project being conducted at the Colorado School of Mines
(CSM) is the <strong>CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed (CHPT)</strong>
– a community-oriented initiative to establish rigorous, quantitative
intercomparison and benchmarking of US operational hydrologic forecasts,
and particularly the multiple elements – models, methods, datasets –
involved in producing them.</p>
<p>The testbed promotes a multi-faceted benchmark-oriented paradigm
through facilitating the use of multiple community-based experimental
protocols with standardized evaluation tools, targeting different
forecasting and forecasting sub-component objectives. Examples of
sub-components include model formulations, model parameterizations
(e.g., a glacier physics algorithm), input datasets, and techniques
(e.g., data assimilation, post-processing, ensemble methods), across
timescales from nowcasting to multi-season prediction.</p>
<h2 id="testbed-linkages">Testbed Linkages</h2>
<p>The testbed depends on linkages with other components of CIROH, and
also leverages external resources, including datasets and expertise from
agencies and groups related to operational Earth System monitoring and
prediction.</p>
<p>Within CIROH, the Testbed project coordinates directly with three
main activities:</p>
<h3 id="model-and-forecast-evaluation">Model and Forecast
Evaluation</h3>
<p>The testbed co-designs forecast-related evaluation experiments and
workflows to make use of the RTI evaluation tools (namely <a
href="https://github.com/RTIInternational/teehr">TEEHR</a>), where
appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="ciroh-cyber-infrastructure">CIROH Cyber-Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The testbed steers and facilitates the use of the CIROH
Cyber-Infrastructure to enable CIROH teams to test innovations and
generate outputs matching the testbed protocols. The C-I and data
science theme projects provide data services and computational resources
that can be used in forecast evaluations.</p>
<h3 id="ciroh-project-advances">CIROH Project Advances</h3>
<p>The ultimate value of the testbed depends on the engagement of CIROH
project teams to assess their innovations in the benchmark-oriented
structure provided by the protocols.</p>
<h3 id="external-coordination">External Coordination</h3>
<p>The testbed also coordinates with other efforts and groups, including
(but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>OWP and NWC (Office of Water Prediction and National Water
Center)</li>
<li>NWS River Forecast Centers</li>
<li>WMO (World Meteorological Organization)</li>
<li>CIROH leadership and RT4 (stakeholder communication and product
activities)</li>
</ul>
<p>These partnerships help translate quantitative testbed insights into
messaging that resonates with forecast users.</p>
<h2 id="engaging-with-the-testbed">Engaging with the Testbed</h2>
<p>CIROH project teams, external collaborators and interested parties
can engage with the testbed through:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Identifying an existing protocol</strong> that aligns with
their research questions or activities</li>
<li><strong>Proposing a new community protocol</strong> to address
emerging evaluation needs</li>
<li><strong>Contacting protocol leads</strong> to discuss project
activities and assess feasibility of running experiments</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: As protocols become established, they become more difficult to
change without affecting the consistency of prior results.</p>
<h2 id="governance-and-activities">Governance and Activities</h2>
<p>The testbed is associated with <strong>CIROH Project 1</strong> (led
by Andy Wood, Colorado School of Mines) and is a core component of
<strong>CIROH Theme 1 – Advancing Operational Prediction</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="steering-and-engagement">Steering and Engagement</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarterly steering group meetings</strong> with leads from
linked activities and CIROH RTs to review progress</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly open webinar/discussion meetings</strong> to
highlight activities and engage the community (CIROH and external)</li>
<li><strong>CIROH Slack testbed channel</strong> available to CIROH
partners to connect with collaborators</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="funding-acknowledgment">Funding Acknowledgment</h2>
<p>This project is supported by the NOAA Cooperative Institute for
Research to Operations in Hydrology. Funding was awarded to CIROH
through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with The University of Alabama
(NA22NWS4320003). The CIROH subproject supporting the testbed is
entitled “CIROH Hydrometeorological Prediction Testbed”, awarded in 2022
and led by Andy Wood.</p>
