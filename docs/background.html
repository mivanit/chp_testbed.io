        <h1>Background</h1>

        

        <p>The CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed is a collaborative platform
built by hydrologists for hydrologists, designed to advance the science
of streamflow prediction through standardized evaluation protocols.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The testbed emerged from a recognized need within the hydrologic
research community to address challenges in model evaluation and
comparison. Historically, hydrologic modeling advances have been
difficult to reproduce and compare due to inconsistent benchmarks,
varying metrics, and isolated academic findings.</p>
<p>This initiative brings together researchers from multiple
institutions to create a unified framework for assessing and
demonstrating advancements in hydrologic forecasting, enabling both
quick exploratory evaluation and formal protocol-based assessments.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>This project addresses key challenges in hydrology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing standardized benchmarks for consistent model
evaluation</li>
<li>Defining common metrics to assess forecasting performance
objectively</li>
<li>Tackling model irreproducibility across different research
groups</li>
<li>Reducing the impact of isolated academic findings that cannot be
validated</li>
<li>Enabling rapid turnaround in forecasting loops for iterative
improvement</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>The testbed is designed to support the hydrologic prediction
community through:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Standardized Protocols</strong> — Define consistent
evaluation frameworks with specified observations, baselines, and
metrics</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Modeling</strong> — Enable teams to share,
edit, and execute models using common infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Transparent Evaluation</strong> — Provide reproducible
performance assessments using tools like TEEHR</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Sharing</strong> — Publish successful protocols
and findings to benefit the broader community</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="consortium">Consortium</h2>
<p>The testbed is a collaborative effort supported by major institutions
in hydrologic research:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CIROH</strong> — Cooperative Institute for Research to
Operations in Hydrology (University of Alabama)</li>
<li><strong>RTI International</strong> — Developers of the TEEHR
evaluation framework</li>
<li><strong>NOAA/NWS</strong> — National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration / National Weather Service</li>
<li><strong>Colorado School of Mines</strong> — Hydrology and Water
Resources Program</li>
</ul>
