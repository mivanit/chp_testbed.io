Focus/Objective, Retrospective streamflow simulation performance across multiple verification features
Observation(s),"-- USGS gage measurements of flow at hourly/daily timesteps"
Reference capabilities (baselines), "-- NWS RFC SAC-SMA/Snow17 \n-- NWM 3.0 streamflow forecasts \n-- Nextgen-based NWM default configuration"
Experimental design, "-- Spatal domain: CAMELS catchments and/or various subsets (e.g., 516 hourly gages, RFC-forecasted)\n-- Validation Period: 10 years of daily streamflow simulations, 1990-99 \n-- Timestep(s): daily, 6-hourly, hourly \n-- Types of validation: (1) temporal across all basins; (2) spatal cross-validation (CV); (3) spatial & temporal CV"
Metrics of performance, "-- Peak flow magnitude and timing; cumulative flow vol. \n-- Modified KGE, NSE \n-- ETS for flow versus defined thresholds (e.g., flood) \n-- Accuracy metrics: correlaton, rBias, RMAE \n-- quandrant bias/corr charts \n-- Metrics also expressed relative to the reference capability"
Other considerations, "-- Computational demand of innovation \n-- Stability of dependencies (method, dataset) \n-- Potental operational latency \n-- Extent of documentation and published research \n-- Potential for forecaster training and real-tme support \n-- Dependency on proprietary resources or methods "
Metadata, "-- Institutional associaton and project lead \n-- Versioning, date of generaton, parameter set and/or algorithm variation, etc. "
